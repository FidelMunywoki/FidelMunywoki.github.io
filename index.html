  		</h1>
  		<p>
        
       Nowadays everywhere you go whether it’s in school or to the gym everyone is listening to music.
          Just by the simple fact that you can have a song that was attached to a memory and it is bringing these nostalgic feelings just by listening to it.
          That is amazing to see, how music can do such a thing. No matter what mood I am in music can change my whole mood just by putting my headphones in and 
          hitting play. The awesome thing about music is that it’s always adapting and evolving. Music will never truly die even if the legends behind the craft do. 
          Therefore, it is important to take note that there is a variety of music out there like the culmination of leaves on a tree. I have chosen to do album reviews 
          because music has helped me during hard times in my life that have helped me overcome obstacles or tune my focus in to get by. It’s true when they say that music
          can say a lot about someone without saying anything. I hope to learn to understand the types of music that may not be my cup of tea, but to understand the culture
          in addition to the richness behind them. The thing with music is that it doesn’t restrict you in who can perceive it, because music can be interpreted by just about
          anyone! I will be using this site of course as others to promote my content such as twitter and Instagram just to name a few to keep followers in the loop.
