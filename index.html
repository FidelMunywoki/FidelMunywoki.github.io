        I truly have enjoyed to have gotten the opportunity to showcase something into existence that I love. 
        One thing that I would like to improve or even include in my website have been to show a little more diversity in genres. 
        Not only showcase rap in all the albums that I was able to review, perhaps throw in there a little bit of rock or country music as well.

           Rap

          J.I.D. has been taken under the wing of “Dreamville” as the young talented prodigy from East Atlanta has come forth with his second album.
          The album “DiCaprio 2” has a total of 14 tracks as J.I.D comes forth with a witfully articulated song such as, “Slick Talk” showing
          that his word play flow is second to none. As the song starts with the repeating of the word, “activate” as to turn on a switch in what
          one is in stored in preparation for his rapping abilities.

       Nowadays everywhere you go whether it’s in school or to the gym everyone is listening to music.
          Just by the simple fact that you can have a song that was attached to a memory and it is bringing these nostalgic feelings just by listening to it.
          That is amazing to see, how music can do such a thing. No matter what mood I am in music can change my whole mood just by putting my headphones in and 
          hitting play. The awesome thing about music is that it’s always adapting and evolving. Music will never truly die even if the legends behind the craft do. 
          Therefore, it is important to take note that there is a variety of music out there like the culmination of leaves on a tree. I have chosen to do album reviews 
          because music has helped me during hard times in my life that have helped me overcome obstacles or tune my focus in to get by. It’s true when they say that music
          can say a lot about someone without saying anything. I hope to learn to understand the types of music that may not be my cup of tea, but to understand the culture
          in addition to the richness behind them. The thing with music is that it doesn’t restrict you in who can perceive it, because music can be interpreted by just about
          anyone! I will be using this site of course as others to promote my content such as twitter and Instagram just to name a few to keep followers in the loop.
